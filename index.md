# TURTLE - The Unmanned Radio Telemetry Limno-Explorer

## About the Project

We – a group of master students of Physical Geography and Geoarcheology of Philipps-University Marburg – want to

- contribute to improve knowledge of the state of river- and lakebeds as well as riparian areas
- facilitate excess to this knowledge for every citizen
- introduce a cost-effective Do-it-Your-Self approach, how to take environmental data in this field
- supply a simple technical guideline combined with basic informatic and UAV-based instructions

by building the TURTLE-platform. This website shows our working procedure and explains how you can get on board!
